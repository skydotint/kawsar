                        <h5>Types of Partnership We Are Offering</h5>
                        <p>There are three ways of becoming a partner:</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Referral Partner</strong></p>
                        <p>Referral Partners can offer their customers, members, readers, visitors or users discounts on Clipping path family services, in addition to the benefits that the Preferred Supplier program offers. Accounts can be created on the Clippingpathfamily.com/ partner name-landing page. Users of these accounts will receive a quote with a substantial discount after they have uploaded their images.</p>
                        <ul class="list-show">
                            <li>Cross-linking (Entry in partner section at Clippingpathfamily.com)</li>
                            <li>Periodic mention in e-mailings/newsletters</li>
                            <li>Joint distribution of a press release about the collaboration</li>
                            <li>Landing page: Clippingpathfamily.com/partners name</li>
                            <li>User discount</li>
                            <li>Users receive quote per job (mixed pricing)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>3. Affiliate Partner</strong></p>
                        <p>To begin with, Affiliate Partners enjoy all the benefits afforded to Preferred Suppliers and Referral Partners. In addition, an API link will be set up between the user interface of the Affiliate Partner and the Clipping path family application. Affiliate Partners receive a commission on all images that are received through the API connection. If customers or users, who make use of Clipping path family services through a partner, want to have large volumes of images edited, Clipping path family can work out a fixed price per photo. This price, in which the user discount is taken into account, will then be used to calculate the partner commission.</p>
                        <ul class="list-show">
                            <li>Cross-linking (Entry in partner section at Clippingpathfamily.com)</li>
                            <li>API connection with the branded Clippingpathfamily.com application</li>
                            <li>Periodic mention in e-mailings/newsletters</li>
                            <li>Joint distribution of press releases about the collaboration</li>
                            <li>User discount (% of sales)</li>
                            <li>Partner commission (% of sales)</li>
                            <li>If desired, fixed pricing for users, for which a separate contract between Clipping path family &amp; the user will be drawn up. (Commission continues to apply)</li>

                        <p><strong>4. Reseller Partner</strong></p>
                        <p>In collaboration with the Reseller Partner, a non-branded frontend is developed in the partner's environment, which is linked to the back-end of the Clipping path family application. The reseller is then able to offer Clipping path family services to its customers or users under its own flag. For the reseller, a fixed rate per photo category is set, allowing the reseller to determine the rates at which the services are offered. Admission into the Reseller Partner program requires a potentially substantial yearly photo volume.</p>
