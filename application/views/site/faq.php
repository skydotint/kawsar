                                            <div class="answer">PayPal is an online payment system that uses e-mail addresses to identify both sender and recipient. Payments are made from the PayPal account of the purchasing party to the PayPal account of the vendor. Neither party gives out information to the other to enable payment. The following is a description of the payment process: <br>
                                            The vendor chooses PayPal as payment method for an order and is then directed to the PayPal website. Here the user must identify himself or herself using an e-mail address and password, to confirm payment.<br>
                                            The amount is then charged to the purchasing party’s PayPal account. The amount is deducted from the purchaser’s PayPal account or charged to the credit card or bank account linked to the PayPal account.</div>

                                            <div class="answer">The most common reason for this is that an eCheck payment has been made through PayPal. Payments using eCheck take 3 to 7 working days to process. Payment of the job will be confirmed the moment we receive the payment in our PayPal account. If you use PayPal, we recommend you do not use eCheck.</div>
